# Sightword game

This is code to render a printable card game.  It is inspired by Spot-It.
If you like it, I encourage you to support them and go buy a copy:

Look in `sightwords/pdf`.  There are several variations, with varying levels of difficulty.
Pick one and print it.  Cut them out.

deck4-5color.pdf will be the easiest.
deck6-bw.pdf will be the hardest.

More colors make it easier.  More words per card make it harder.

The point of the game is that for any two cards there will be exactly one word that matches.
The game is generally competitive -- turn up two cards, and whoever finds the match first wins 
those cards.
